🌱 Beginner JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly JavaScript projects.
This repository is meant to showcase my learning journey and growth in JavaScript by building small, functional projects.

Each project focuses on a different fundamental concept such as user input, conditionals, functions, and basic DOM interaction.
