üå± Beginner JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly JavaScript projects.
This repository is meant to showcase my learning journey and growth in JavaScript by building small, functional projects.

Each project focuses on a different fundamental concept such as user input, conditionals, functions, and basic DOM interaction.

üìÇ Projects Inside

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Distance Converter  
- Convert between different units (Miles, Kilometers, Feet).  
- Uses **functions** to take user input and display results.  
- Shows how to handle **multiple choices** with buttons.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Rock Paper Scissors Game  
- Classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** against the computer.  
- Uses **functions** for game logic and **Math.random()** for randomness.  
- Extended version uses an **object (`score`)** and **localStorage (JSON.stringify / JSON.parse)** to save scores.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Amazon Products (Objects Practice)  
- Created **product objects** with properties (`name`, `price`, `delivery_time`).  
- Used **dot notation** to update properties.  
- Added new properties dynamically.  
- Wrote functions to **compare two products** by price.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Calculator (Eval Version)  
- A simple calculator using buttons for digits and operators.  
- Stores the expression in a **string variable** and evaluates it using `eval()`.  
- Demonstrates **functions, memory allocation, and DOM events**.  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cart Quantity Project  
- A small **shopping cart simulator**.  
- Buttons to increase, decrease, and reset cart quantity.  
- Teaches **variables in memory, increment/decrement operators, and event-driven functions**.  

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Coin Toss Game  
- Simulates flipping a coin (**Heads/Tails**).  
- Uses **random numbers** and a **ternary operator**.  
- Demonstrates **functions** and comparison logic.  

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Objects Equality Check (Practice)  
- Functions to check if two object properties have the same value.  
- Returns **true** or **false** depending on comparison.  
- Reinforces working with **functions + objects**.
